# Inventory Management Web API Features

## 1. Product Management
- **Create Product**: Ability to add a new product to the inventory.
  - Validate required fields (name, price, quantity).
  - Generate a unique product ID.
- **Read Products**: Ability to fetch a list of all products.
  - Support filtering (e.g., by category, price range).
- **Get Product by ID**: Ability to fetch details of a single product by its ID.
- **Update Product**: Ability to update an existing product’s information (name, description, quantity, price, category).
  - Validate the new data before updating.
- **Delete Product**: Ability to delete a product from the inventory by its ID.

## 2. CRUD Operations
- Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing products.
  - Use in-memory data storage (e.g., `List<Product>`) initially or switch to a database later.

## 3. Validation
- **Field Validation**: Ensure fields are valid before accepting data (e.g., ensure price > 0, quantity >= 0).
- **Existence Check**: Ensure a product exists before trying to update or delete.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure updates don’t break data consistency (e.g., no negative quantities).

## 4. Search and Filter
- **Search**: Provide an option to search for products by name, description, or category.
- **Filtering**: Implement filtering by price range, category, or availability (e.g., quantity > 0).

## 5. API Documentation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Integrate Swagger to auto-generate API documentation, making it easier for developers to test and interact with the API.

## 6. Authentication and Authorization (Optional)
- **API Key Authentication**: Implement API key-based authentication for controlling access to the API.
- **JWT Authentication**: For more advanced security, implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to manage user sessions.
- **Role-based Authorization**: If needed, implement roles (e.g., Admin, User) with specific permissions for accessing certain API endpoints.

## 7. Error Handling
- **Custom Error Messages**: Return meaningful error messages when something goes wrong (e.g., validation errors, not found).
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Ensure the appropriate status codes (200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) are returned with each response.
- **Global Error Handling**: Implement global exception handling (using middleware) to handle unexpected errors.

## 8. Logging
- **Request and Response Logging**: Log incoming requests and responses for debugging and auditing purposes.
- **Error Logging**: Log errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting (e.g., stack trace, request details).
- **Performance Logging**: Optionally, track the performance of each endpoint (e.g., request duration).

## 9. Versioning
- **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility when making changes to the API.
- **Route Prefix**: Use version prefixes like `/api/v1/products` for version management.

## 10. Unit Testing
- **Test API Endpoints**: Write unit tests for each of the API endpoints using a testing framework like `xUnit` or `NUnit`.
- **Test Business Logic**: Unit tests for validation and CRUD operations logic.

## 11. Rate Limiting (Optional)
- **Limit Requests**: Implement rate limiting to avoid abuse of the API and protect it from excessive requests (e.g., limit requests to 100 per minute).

## 12. Deployment
- **Local Development**: Ensure the application runs locally with ease using tools like Docker or a local database (SQL Server, SQLite, etc.).
- **Cloud Deployment**: Prepare the application for deployment to cloud platforms (e.g., Azure or AWS) with environment configurations.

## 13. User Interface (Optional)
- **Frontend Integration**: If you wish, you could later develop a simple frontend (using HTML, CSS, JS, React, or Angular) to interact with the API and visualize the inventory.
